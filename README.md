# raku Dan::Polars

This is a new module to bind raku [Dan](https://github.com/p6steve/raku-Dan) to Polars via Raku NativeCall / Rust FFI.

The following broad capabilities are envisaged:
- Polars structures (Series, DataFrames) as opaque shadows
- Polars expressions (via Polars::dsl)
- Polars lazy APIs (via raku lazy semantics)
- handle map & apply (with raku callbacks)
- raku Dan features (accessors, dtypes, base methods, Dan::As::Query API extension)
- broad datatype support & mapping
- concurrency

The ultimate aim is to emulate the examples in the [Polars User Guide](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/dsl/expressions.html)

## All is strictly pre-release and only if you know what you are doing!!!
 
## Installation
 
Utilize [p6steve/raku-Dockerfiles/raku-dan-polars/stage-2](https://github.com/p6steve/raku-Dockerfiles/blob/main/raku-dan-polars/stage-2/Dockerfile) directly, Docker Hub images are named something like [p6steve/raku-dan:polars-2022.02-arm64](hub.docker.com) - choose arm64 / amd64 for your machine. Or plunder the Dockerfiles for how to build your own environment.
 
deploy Dan::Polars like this ...
```
docker run -it p6steve/raku-dan:polars-2022.02-arm64 #(or -amd64)
zef install Dan;
git clone https://github.com/p6steve/raku-Dan-Polars.git
cd raku-Dan-Polars
cd dan
cargo build
cd ../bin
./synopsis-dan-polars4.raku #(or 1,2,3)
```

Day 13 â€“ A Little R&R
A Little R&R Introduction Raku is a really nice language. Versatile, expressive, fast, dwimmy. The only problem I sometimes have with it is that it can be a little slow. Fortunately that can eaâ€¦

[20:09]
according to this blog, one can make a FFI binding between Raku and Rust
[20:11]
But, @ritchie46  prolly too busy keeping rust and python lib of polars updated. So additional external effort may be needed

Yeap.. ðŸ˜…
[14:59]
can an FFI capable languge be bound to polars that way reasonably effectively and is there any example/documentation/cheat sheet/advice I can use to avoid reinventing wheels

Yes, definitely look at the python implementation as the reference implementation. The interop goes very well. There are also bindings to nodejs which also may be helpful. The work of @universalmind303 proves that the port is definitely possible and a lot less work than starting from scratch (Trust me, I've got a lot of time in this ;))

20:37	discord-raku-bot	<Anton Antonov> @japhb I got a CBOR file -- how do I read it in Raku? Using `slurp` with ":bin" ?
20:49	discord-raku-bot	<Anton Antonov> @japhp Yeah, I got it working. And, yes, the CBOR utilization gives me the fastest ingestion of â‰ˆ700MB CSV file in Raku.

## TODOs
### v1

1. [ ] Dan API
   - [x] Dan::Series base methods
   - [x] Dan::DataFrame base methods
   - [ ] Dan Accessors
   - [ ] Dan slice & concat (s1)
   - [ ] Dan sort & grep (s3)
   - [ ] cross join (aka cross product)
   
2. [x] Polars Structs / Modules
   - [x] Polars::Series base methods
   - [x] Polars::DataFrame base methods
   - [x] .push/.pull (set-new/get-data)
   
3. [ ] Polars Exprs (s2)
   - [x] unary exprs
   - [ ] operators
   - [ ] map & apply

4. [ ] Test
 
This will then provide a basis for Dan::As::Query v1 for Dan and Dan::Pandas

### v2
- [ ] expr arity > 1
- [ ] clone (then retest h2o-par)
- [ ] reset @data after load rc (also to Pandas)
- [ ] datetime
- [ ] better value return
- [ ] serde
- [ ] strip / fold Index
 
###v3
- [ ] ternary if-then-else (Dan::As::Ternary)
- [ ] str operations (Dan::As::Str)
- [ ] chunked transfer
 
## Design Principles
--
1. lazy

Polars implements both lazy and eager APIs, these are functionally similar. For simplicity, Dan::Polars offers only the most efficient: lazy API. It has better query optimisation with low additional overhead.

2. auto-lazy

In Rust & Python Polars, lazy must be explicitly requested with ```.lazy .. .collect``` methods around expressions. In contrast, Dan::Polars auto-generates the ```.lazy .. .collect``` quietly for concise syntax.

3. pure

[Polars Expressions](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/dsl/intro.html) are a function mapping from a series to a series (or mathematically ```Fn(Series) -> Series```). As expressions have a Series as an input and a Series as an output then it is straightforward to do a pipeline of expressions.

4. opaque
 
In general each raku object (Dan::Polars::Series, Dan::Polars::DataFrame) maintains a unique pointer to a rust container (SeriesC, DataFrameC) and they contain a shadow Rust Polars Struct. Methods invoked on the raku object are then proxied over to the Rust Polars shadow. 
 
5. dynamic lib.so
 
A connection is made via Raku Nativecall to Rust FFI using a ```lib.so`` dymanic library or equivalent.
 
5. data transfer

Usually no data needs to be transferred from Raku to Rust (or vice versa). For example, a raku script can command a Rust Polars DataFrame to be read from a csv file, apply expressions and output the result. The data items all remain on the Rust side of the connection.
 
Some use cases require data transfer - such as using the Rust fast read_csv to import a DataFrame from disk like this:
 
```
use Dan;
use Dan::Polars;

my \df = DataFrame.new;
df.read_csv("/tmp/docdir/1mSalesRecords.csv");

say ~df.Dan-DataFrame;   #cast Dan::Polars::DataFrame to raku Dan::DataFrame
 ```

A blog post on transfer performance is forthcoming...

# raku-Curve

So I googled <butterfly polar> and got a [Butterfly Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_curve_(transcendental))
  
How's that for an instant module name and mascot...
  ...so far that's all that this module has - **WORK IN PROGRESS**
  
First step is to get a Dockerfile up... likely candidate is 
  - https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html
  - https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/scipy-notebook
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/scipy-notebook/tags/
  
Then pip install polars and some raku.
